Haha! Business! quote
We believe everyone can be a CEO

But we still need someone at the top and that is the Pharaoh, because we believe that modern business has a lot to learn from ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was so successful, in the business sense, that they all became rich enough to retire and pave the way for newer civilisations to rise in their stead
